# Mafia
Mafia is a generator gem that creates the directory structure and files for a [sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com) app that is also a gem in itself. The benefits for writing sinatra apps as gems is you can make your apps more modular and easily use them as rack middleware.
 
## Usage
    sudo gem install mafia
    mafia appname
